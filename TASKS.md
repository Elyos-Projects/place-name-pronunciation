# TASKS — place-name-pronunciation

> Status: Draft · Version: 0.1.0 · Last updated: 2026-06-28 · Owner: TBD (maintainer) · Lane: donated

Itemized backlog for the open, consent-first corpus of place-name pronunciations (audio + IPA +
respelling + sourced origin notes). See [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) for positioning, the licensing and
consent gates, and the roadmap (M0–M3).

## How these tasks map to Elyos

Each task below becomes an Elyos **Task JSON** validated against
`packages/schema/src/schemas.ts`. Field mapping:

- **id** — stable `place-name-pronunciation-<area>-NNN` (the table ID).
- **title** — the table Title.
- **project** — `place-name-pronunciation`.
- **type** — one of `code | research | writing | data | design-spec | maintenance` (table "Type").
- **lane** — `donated` for all tasks here. Any future metered run would be `funded` and must add
  `fundedBudgetUsd`.
- **priority** — `high | medium | low`.
- **domain** — e.g. `["language","accessibility","open-culture","geography","public-data"]`.
- **riskTier** — `low | medium | high`. Consent/privacy, etymology accuracy, and
  Indigenous/minority-language tasks are **medium**; scaffolding/docs/code are **low**. No `high`.
- **urgent** — boolean (default `false`).
- **deliverable** — `pr | dataset | document | translation` (table "Deliverable").
- **tokenEstimate** — `small | medium | large` (table "Size").
- **status** — `open | in-progress | review | delivered | done` (start `open`).
- **context / objective / acceptanceCriteria[] / resources[] / output** — per task.
- **requestor** — `jdev1977` / beneficiary class until a named partner is secured.
- **verifiedNeed** — **`false`** while no committed partner/steward is secured (honest; the gap is
  real but the last-mile beneficiary is **TO BE SECURED**).
- **outputLicense** — `MIT` (code), `CC0-1.0` (metadata / PD-derived), `CC-BY-4.0` (audio,
  transcriptions, docs by default), or `CC-BY-SA-4.0` (where CC BY-SA source is incorporated).

> **Standing guardrails on every data/recording task (binding):**
> 1. **No recording is ingested without a complete, valid `ConsentRecord`** (license grant + voice
>    release + withdrawal terms). CI fails otherwise.
> 2. **No source is touched until its `sources/allowlist.yml` entry is `approved`** by the license
>    reviewer. Forvo and any proprietary pronunciation DB are **categorically rejected**.
> 3. **Indigenous/minority-language names** require a community-steward sign-off (CARE); absent a
>    steward, they are **not published**.
> 4. **No synthetic/TTS/voice-cloned audio. No biometric/voiceprint/surveillance use.** Refuse and
>    flag.

## Milestone M0 — Foundation, consent spine & cold-start

| ID | Title | Type | Size | Risk | Deliverable | Depends on | Reviewer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| place-name-pronunciation-schema-001 | Define core data model (Place/Recording/Speaker/ConsentRecord/OriginNote/Provenance) | design-spec | medium | low | document | — | Maintainer |
| place-name-pronunciation-consent-001 | Ratify consent record schema + speaker release + withdrawal terms | design-spec | small | medium | document | place-name-pronunciation-schema-001 | Privacy/consent reviewer |
| place-name-pronunciation-license-001 | Source allow-list schema + license policy (Forvo/proprietary rejected) | design-spec | small | medium | document | — | License reviewer |
| place-name-pronunciation-license-002 | Analyze & record first 3 candidate sources (≥1 approved) | research | medium | medium | document | place-name-pronunciation-license-001 | License reviewer |
| place-name-pronunciation-id-001 | Commit host-independent persistent ID namespace (w3id.org/PURL) | design-spec | small | low | document | place-name-pronunciation-schema-001 | Maintainer |
| place-name-pronunciation-ci-001 | CI: schema + license-allowlist + consent-completeness + provenance gates | code | medium | low | pr | place-name-pronunciation-schema-001, place-name-pronunciation-consent-001, place-name-pronunciation-license-001 | Maintainer |
| place-name-pronunciation-partner-001 | Steward + community-partner outreach (Wikimedia/library/revival org/broadcaster) | research | small | low | document | — | Maintainer |

**Acceptance criteria (key M0 tasks)**

- **place-name-pronunciation-schema-001**
  - All six record types defined with fields, datatypes, and cardinality; Ajv-valid JSON Schema +
    generated TS types.
  - `variantType` (`local|official|anglicised|historical|other`) and `dualNames` modelled as
    first-class fields — variation and contested names are data, not free text.
  - Every Recording reserves mandatory `consentRef` + `provenance` slots.
  - Speaker record carries **no** legal name/contact/precise location (pseudonymous by design).
- **place-name-pronunciation-consent-001**
  - Consent schema captures: license granted (CC-BY-4.0 / CC0-1.0), explicit public-reuse + voice
    release, withdrawal process, CARE/community-stewardship flag, date, verification method.
  - Withdrawal terms state honestly that third-party copies cannot be recalled; corpus + future
    exports will drop withdrawn recordings.
  - Minors/vulnerable-speaker clause (guardian consent + extra review; default avoid).
- **place-name-pronunciation-license-001**
  - `allowlist.yml` schema: title, custodian, URL, format, license/PD basis, attribution string,
    `status: approved|rejected|pending`.
  - Policy text categorically rejects Forvo and any reuse-restricted pronunciation DB; documents
    per-file CC verification for Wikimedia/Lingua Libre and ODbL share-alike handling for OSM.
- **place-name-pronunciation-ci-001**
  - CI fails on any record without a resolvable provenance link.
  - CI fails on any recording lacking a complete, valid `ConsentRecord`.
  - CI rejects data referencing a source not marked `approved` in the allow-list.

**M0 Definition of Done:** core schema published + Ajv-valid; consent record schema ratified;
allow-list schema + policy merged with ≥3 sources analysed and ≥1 approved; host-independent ID
namespace committed; CI consent + license + provenance gates live; steward/community outreach
initiated and logged; **a privacy/consent reviewer AND a cultural/linguistic reviewer named (hard
exit — if a seat is empty, M0 cannot exit; escalate per PLAN.md fallback)**.
`pnpm build && pnpm test && pnpm lint` green.
